# Instructions

You have twenty to seconds to click on a "mole" (the circle) whenever a black dot appears within it.  In the end, you will have a total score of how many moles you've hit, and the amount of moles you've missed.  Have fun!

If you're on Internet Explorer 11+ and you see a message that says "Internet Explorer restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls," click on the button that says "Allow blocked content" to see the moles.

# Features
Three buttons- one to stop the game, one to stop the game temporarily, and one to reset the game (your high score will still be saved!)

# Accessibility
This game is color compliant.  Use tabs to switch in between the three buttons (Stop, Start, Reset) and hit enter to select the button you're on.
