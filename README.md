# Instructions

You have a total of thirty seconds, and the goal is to click as many "moles" as you can before time runs out.  In the end, you will have a score of the number of moles you've hit, as well as the amount of moles you've missed.  

There are also three buttons: Stop (to temporarily pause your game), Start (to start your game initially, or to start it again after you've stopped it), and Reset (to reset your game, your high score will still be saved.)

If you're on Internet Explorer 11+ and you see a message that says "Internet Explorer restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls," click on the button that says "Allow blocked content" to see the moles.
